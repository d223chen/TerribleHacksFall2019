Water particle collision simulation, the project I did at TerribleHacks Fall 2019.
+ a factory.

Press "H" or "O" to put Hydrogen and Oxygen atoms on the pipe.
A water particle is formed when 2 hydrogens and 1 oxygen are at the barrier simultaneously

The particles collide elastically.


To make, type `make`. To run, type `./main.sh`


Implemented using C++ and the NCurses library.
